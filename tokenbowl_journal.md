## August 28, 2025 - Redis Caching Implementation

### Challenge
- Sleeper API's `/players/nfl` endpoint returns ~12MB uncompressed JSON (5000+ players)
- Initial attempt to cache in Redis failed - exceeded 25MB free tier limit
- MCP tools timing out trying to fetch full player dataset

### Solution Implemented
- **Created Redis instance** on Render (`tokenbowl-cache`, ID: `red-d2o755emcj7s73b8bj9g`)
- **Smart filtering**: Cache only active/relevant players (~2000 vs 5000+)
- **Gzip compression**: 12MB → 2MB filtered → 0.4MB compressed
- **Result**: Fits easily in 25MB Redis free tier with room to spare

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified
- `players_cache_redis.py` - Added compression and smart filtering
- `sleeper_mcp.py` - Integrated cached player tools
- `pyproject.toml` - Added redis dependency

#### New MCP Tools Added
- `search_player_by_name` - Search players by partial/full name
- `get_player_by_sleeper_id` - Direct lookup by Sleeper ID  
- `get_players_cache_status` - Check cache freshness
- `refresh_players_cache` - Force cache update
- Modified `get_nfl_players` to use cache

#### Infrastructure
- **Service**: `tokenbowl-mcp` (ID: `srv-d2o5vv95pdvs739hqde0`)
- **Redis**: Free tier, LRU eviction policy
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploy on push to main branch
- **Environment**: `REDIS_URL` configured for internal connection

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `NoneType` comparison error in player filtering logic
- Handled both compressed and uncompressed data retrieval
- Added proper error handling for Redis connection failures

### Testing
- Successfully searched for Josh Allen (QB, Bills, ID: 4984)
- Successfully searched for Patrick Mahomes (QB, Chiefs, ID: 4046)  
- Verified trending players functionality
- Confirmed 24-hour TTL and auto-refresh

### Key Learnings
- JSON compression ratios can be 5-6x for repetitive data
- Redis stores uncompressed data by default
- Filtering irrelevant data before caching is crucial for memory optimization
- Render's internal Redis URLs only work from services in same region

### Next Steps
- [ ] Add more advanced search filters (by team, position, etc.)
- [ ] Implement player stats caching
- [ ] Add draft optimization tools
- [ ] Create league-specific player rankings

## Deployment Notes

### Render MCP Integration
Using Render MCP server for production management:
- `mcp__render__list_services` - Monitor services
- `mcp__render__get_deploy` - Check deployment status
- `mcp__render__list_logs` - Debug production issues
- `mcp__render__update_environment_variables` - Update config

### Current Production Status
- ✅ MCP server live at https://tokenbowl-mcp.onrender.com
- ✅ Redis cache operational
- ✅ All player search tools functioning
- ✅ Auto-deploy enabled for main branch
