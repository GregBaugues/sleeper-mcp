# Issue #23: Phase 3 - Data Enrichment and Merging Logic Implementation Plan

**GitHub Issue**: [#23 - Phase 3: Build data enrichment and merging logic](https://github.com/GregBaugues/sleeper-mcp/issues/23)

## Overview
Implement the core enrichment logic that merges Sleeper and Fantasy Nerds data into unified player objects. This is Phase 3 of the Fantasy Nerds integration, building on the completed Phase 1 (API client and mapper) and Phase 2 (Redis caching).

## Current State Analysis

### Completed Components
- ✅ **Phase 1** (PR #26): 
  - `ffnerd/client.py` - Fantasy Nerds API client with async methods
  - `ffnerd/mapper.py` - Player ID mapping between Sleeper and Fantasy Nerds
  - Tests for client and mapper functionality
  
- ✅ **Phase 2** (assumed completed based on files):
  - `ffnerd/cache.py` - Redis caching layer for Fantasy Nerds data
  - Tests for cache operations
  
### Existing Infrastructure
- Redis connection via `REDIS_URL` environment variable
- Compression using gzip (level 9) for storage optimization
- TTL-based cache expiration for different data types
- Existing player cache for Sleeper data in `players_cache_redis.py`

## Implementation Design

### 1. Core Enricher Module (`ffnerd/enricher.py`)

#### Class Structure
```python
class PlayerEnricher:
    """Enriches Sleeper player data with Fantasy Nerds information."""
    
    def __init__(self, mapper: PlayerMapper, cache: FantasyNerdsCache):
        self.mapper = mapper
        self.cache = cache
        self.metrics = EnrichmentMetrics()
    
    async def enrich_player(self, sleeper_player: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Enrich single player with Fantasy Nerds data."""
        
    async def enrich_players(self, players: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Bulk enrichment for multiple players."""
        
    def calculate_confidence(self, player_data: Dict, ffnerd_data: Dict) -> float:
        """Calculate enrichment confidence score."""
```

#### Enrichment Process Flow
1. Extract Sleeper player ID from player data
2. Map to Fantasy Nerds ID using PlayerMapper
3. Retrieve cached Fantasy Nerds data if available
4. Merge data without modifying original Sleeper fields
5. Calculate confidence score based on data completeness
6. Track metrics for monitoring
7. Return enriched player object

#### Data Structure
```python
{
    # Original Sleeper data (unchanged)
    "player_id": "4046",
    "full_name": "Patrick Mahomes",
    "team": "KC",
    "position": "QB",
    # ... other Sleeper fields
    
    # Fantasy Nerds enrichment (added)
    "ffnerd_data": {
        "projections": {
            "week": 1,
            "points": 24.5,
            "passing_yards": 298,
            # ... detailed stats
        },
        "injury": {
            "status": "Healthy",
            "description": None,
            "last_update": "2025-01-05"
        },
        "news": [
            {
                "headline": "...",
                "date": "...",
                "link": "..."
            }
        ],
        "rankings": {
            "overall": 2,
            "position": 1
        },
        "enriched_at": "2025-01-05T10:00:00Z",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "ffnerd_id": 1823
    }
}
```

### 2. Enrichment Utilities

#### Field Mapping
- Map Fantasy Nerds field names to standardized format
- Handle different data types and units
- Normalize team abbreviations

#### Data Validation
- Verify data types match expected schemas
- Check for required fields
- Validate numeric ranges (e.g., projections > 0)

#### Conflict Resolution
- Priority: Sleeper data always takes precedence
- Fantasy Nerds data is supplementary only
- Handle null/missing values gracefully

### 3. Enrichment Metrics

#### Metrics to Track
- Total players processed
- Successfully enriched count
- Missing mapping count
- Average confidence score
- Enrichment time per player
- Cache hit/miss rates
- API errors encountered

#### Implementation
```python
class EnrichmentMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_processed = 0
        self.successful_enrichments = 0
        self.missing_mappings = 0
        self.confidence_scores = []
        self.processing_times = []
        
    def record_enrichment(self, success: bool, confidence: float, time_ms: float):
        """Record metrics for a single enrichment."""
        
    def get_summary(self) -> Dict:
        """Get metrics summary."""
```

### 4. Integration Points

#### Update `sleeper_mcp.py` Tools
- Modify `get_nfl_players()` to include enrichment
- Update `search_player_by_name()` with enriched results
- Add enrichment flag parameter (default: True)

#### Update `players_cache_redis.py`
- Import PlayerEnricher
- Add optional enrichment in get methods
- Preserve backwards compatibility

### 5. Test Implementation (`tests/test_ffnerd_enricher.py`)

#### Test Cases
1. **Successful Enrichment**
   - Player with valid mapping
   - All Fantasy Nerds data available
   - Verify data structure

2. **Missing Mapping**
   - Player without Fantasy Nerds ID
   - Should return unenriched data
   - No errors thrown

3. **Partial Data**
   - Missing projections but has injuries
   - Handle gracefully
   - Calculate appropriate confidence

4. **Bulk Operations**
   - Enrich 1000+ players
   - Verify performance < 1 second
   - Check memory usage

5. **Data Type Conversions**
   - String to number conversions
   - Date parsing
   - Handle edge cases

6. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Full data = 0.95+ confidence
   - Partial data = 0.5-0.94 confidence
   - No data = 0 confidence

### 6. Manual Test Script (`scripts/test_enrichment.py`)

#### Functionality
- Connect to Redis
- Load sample Sleeper players
- Create mapper and cache instances
- Run enrichment
- Display results with formatting
- Show metrics summary
- Compare enriched vs unenriched data

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup**

   - Review existing code structure

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Create `ffnerd/enricher.py` with PlayerEnricher class
   - Implement single player enrichment
   - Add bulk enrichment with async operations
   - Implement confidence scoring

3. **Utilities**
   - Add data validation helpers
   - Create field normalization functions
   - Implement conflict resolution

4. **Metrics**
   - Create EnrichmentMetrics class
   - Add tracking throughout enrichment
   - Implement summary reporting

5. **Testing**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Test with real data

6. **Integration**
   - Update MCP tools to use enrichment
   - Test end-to-end flow
   - Verify backwards compatibility

7. **Documentation**
   - Add docstrings to all methods
   - Create example enriched JSON
   - Update README if needed

8. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run full test suite
   - Run linting (`uv run ruff check .`)
   - Run formatting (`uv run ruff format .`)
   - Check test coverage

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Enrichment adds Fantasy Nerds data without modifying Sleeper data
- ✅ Missing mappings handled gracefully (returns unenriched)
- ✅ Bulk enrichment processes 1000+ players in <1 second
- ✅ Confidence scores accurately reflect data quality
- ✅ Test coverage >80% for enricher module
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Linting passes (ruff)
- ✅ Documentation complete with examples

## Performance Considerations

- Use async/await for concurrent operations
- Batch Redis lookups when possible
- Minimize memory allocations in loops
- Use dict comprehensions for efficiency
- Profile with large datasets

## Error Handling

- Graceful degradation on cache miss
- Log warnings for missing mappings
- Handle corrupt cache data
- Timeout handling for slow operations
- Clear error messages in logs

## Next Steps

After completing this phase:
1. Phase 4: Implement scheduler for periodic updates
2. Phase 5: Add monitoring and alerting
3. Phase 6: Production deployment configuration
